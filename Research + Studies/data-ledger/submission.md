# Submission for the Labs Decentralizing Research Bounties

## Project Name

Data Ledger

## Project Summary

Data sharing is an important area in today's scientific research which is using more and more data technologies such as big data and machine learning.

While open data is very important and helpful, researchers met quite a lot of challenges when requesting senstivie data with privacy from today's big data owners such as governments and commercial corporations. Blockchain has the potential to improve the transparency, security and efficiency of data sharing significantly when combined with other modern technologies.
